# BrowserDemux - open links in different browsers, depending on what is in the URL

## This is currently work in progress, stay tuned

BrowserDemux is a utility that replaces your default browsers and launches on of the browser installed in your system
depending on the link that you open.

For example, if you use Chrome as your browser for work and Firefox for everything else you can configure 
BrowserDemux to open Slack, JIRA and other work-related sites in Chrome and other links in Firefox.

This works when you open links from an application (email client, messenger, etc.), 
not when you click a link in the browser.
